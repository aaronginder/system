System Programming
------------------
# Problem Statement:
My computer keeps freeze and is processing tasks slowly. Other than using Task Manager to view the performance of my computer and resource usage, I do not have any way of tracking my computer resource usage over time. By creating a solution that allows me to track this, I can see what processes slow my computer over time and kill these tasks.

# Purpose:
The main aims of this project are:

1) To create a monitoring process that reports on my computer usage over time
2) To derive insight from a series of visualisations using Tableau or Python (matplotlib library)
3) To create an automated solution that kills tasks that consume lots of resource unnecessarily

# Key Objectives:
1) To free up at least 15% of my computer resources that are currently being utilised in background tasks
2) To automatically generate and send an email to me on a weekly basis that provides a summary of my current computer resource uses
3) To write and publish an article on Towards Data Science
